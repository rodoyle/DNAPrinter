The ultimate goal of this project is to design the software components
required to design DNA constructs and then parse them for automated synthesis.

More information will be added.

Priorities:

1) Learn/Practice coding
2) Develop "DNA feature" data structure, automatically build DNAfeature DB from 
online reposistories (BB foundation, Genbank reference sequenes, etc)
3) Import and Parse DNA sequences, annotate using DNA feature Database. Develop
DNAFragment and DNA Construct data structures
4) Develop "Compiler" for synthesis with oligo synthesizers

5) Experiment with github as a way to do version control on DNA sequence files.
